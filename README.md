# Assignment-4


This repository contains two Python programs for basic file handling operations.

## Files

  If the file does not exist, it shows an error message.

- **Task 2.py**  
  - Takes user input and writes it to `output.txt`.  
  - Asks for more input and appends it on a new line.  
  - Finally, reads and displays the full content of `output.txt`.

- **sample.txt**  
  A sample text file used for testing Task 1.
